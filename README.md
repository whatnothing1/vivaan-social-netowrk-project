## Algorithms - Login Page

1. User opens the login page.
2. User enters username and password.
3. System checks if username exists in the database.
   - If NO → Display "User not found" message and stop.
4. If YES → Retrieve stored password for that username.
5. Compare entered password with stored password.
   - If match → Create session token and log user in.  
     Redirect to dashboard/home page.
   - If no match → Display "Incorrect password" message and stop.  
END

Week 5- SQL and Queries
This week, I created mock data and successfully imported it into VS Code using SQLite. I then wrote and tested several SQL queries on the dataset, which allowed me to retrieve and analyze useful information. Through this process, I learned how to manage data in a database environment and gained insights into how queries can be used to answer specific questions.

Week 6-7 Making webpages and styling
This week, I created the homepage for the website and applied basic styling using HTML and CSS. The homepage layout was set up to match the planned design, and I experimented with colors and fonts to fit the NBA theme. This was my first step in building the user interface for the project.
