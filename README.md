## Algorithms - Login Page

1. User opens the login page.
2. User enters username and password.
3. System checks if username exists in the database.
   - If NO → Display "User not found" message and stop.
4. If YES → Retrieve stored password for that username.
5. Compare entered password with stored password.
   - If match → Create session token and log user in.  
     Redirect to dashboard/home page.
   - If no match → Display "Incorrect password" message and stop.  
END
